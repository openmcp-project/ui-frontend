## About This Project

This repository contains code relevant for the frontend component required in the Managed Control Plane UI (MCP UI), which is part of the @openmcp-project, more info [here](https://github.com/openmcp-project).

The MCP UI enables endusers to work with Managed Control Planes, without having to use kubectl. Note that the current focus of the UI is on displaying information about the various managed resources, as well as the MCP instances themselves. It is also possible to check the status of the resources, and display / copy their YAML representations.

Overall, the UI provides an easy jump-start for everyone interested in checking the status of Managed Control Planes, without having to use kubectl.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

#### Configure Frontend

- Copy `frontend-config.json` to `public/frontend-config.json` and adapt the `backendUrl` according to your setup (see section Dynamic Frontend Config).
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in the missing values.

#### Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The UI will be served on http://localhost:5173.


#### Safari Support

**Note:** The frontend is currently incompatible with Safari when running locally on `localhost`.

To enable local development with Safari, follow these steps on your local machine:

1. **Update Cookie Settings:**  
   In [`server/encrypted-session.js`](server/encrypted-session.ts), set the `secure` property to `false` in both occurrences.

2. **Disable Helmet Registration:**  
   In [`server.js`](server.ts), comment out or remove the registration of `helmet`.


### Build & Production

#### Build the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Serve the Production Build Locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

#### Production Deployment

Use the docker image which uses nginx for best performance and small bundle size.

```bash
docker build -t my-label .
```

### Dynamic FrontendConfig

The frontend loads a `frontend-config.json` file from the root folder containing dynamic config like the backend url. For development, the file `frontend-config.json` can be copied to `public/frontend-config.json`. For production, NGINX will serve the content from the environment variable `BACKEND_CONFIG`.

An example docker run command would be 
```
docker run -p 5001:80 -e BACKEND_CONFIG="$(cat frontend-config.json)"  -t ui-test
```
