# ui-frontend

## About this project

UI frontend forÂ @openmcp-project

## Requirements and Setup

### Development

1. install dependencies: `npm i`

1. Copy the `frontend-config.json` to `public/frontend-config.json` and adapt the `backendUrl` according to your setup (see section Dynamic Frontend Config).

1. Connect to the ui-backend server
   **Run it locally**:
    - See `https://github.com/openmcp-project/ui-backend`

1. Start the application:

   Run `npm run dev`

### Build

1. Build the application:

   Run `npm run build`

2. Serve the application locally:

   Run `npm run preview`

3. For production:

   Use the docker image which uses nginx for best performance and small bundle size.
   `docker build -t my-label .`

### Dynamic FrontendConfig

The frontend loads a `frontend-config.json` file from the root folder containing dynamic config like the backend url. For development, the file `frontend-config.json` can be copied to `public/frontend-config.json`. For production, NGINX will serve the content from the environment variable `BACKEND_CONFIG`.

An example docker run command would be 
```
docker run -p 5001:80 -e BACKEND_CONFIG="$(cat frontend-config.json)"  -t ui-test
```
